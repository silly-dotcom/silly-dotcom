heavy dni if your gonna judge me for a pony that doesn't even prove my ideology [my TR pony] , but main things to know before you click my links, 1; im anxious, nervous and often have to muster up courage for things, so dont be offended if i dont reply or just stay quiet, im trying my best. 2; im interested in the dsmp, which is a huse dni for some people, so please just block me. [I DO NOT SUPPORT CC!DREAM OR CC!WILBUR, I DO NOT HAVE EXACT CONFORMATION THAT DREAM IS INNOCENT.] 3; im trying to be online more often and sit with more friends, but its harder when i have so many friends i like, so feel free to start a cuddle pile if you want to sit with me, i don't mind. 4; i do admire some people in the comunity, please do not mind if i sound nervous or awkward when talking to you, i either find you cool or its my brain trying to figrue out what to say. 5; i am in problematic fandoms like countryhumans and have a weird interest in ww2 history, i am also possibly autistic [i am not diagnosed, my mom is a nurse and says i most likely have a bit of autism in me, i will eventually get a diagnosis if i ask enough.] and have a big interest in oppenheimer, please do not mind if i go on some weird rant about Oppenheimer. sorry this is so long, and send me a thumbs up if you actually read this, that would be nice! now, heres my extra links besides my normal links that i couldn't fit;  https://colormytree.me/2025/01KBBJT8V1A1GK9HKRBFG2AEMQ https://www.last.fm/user/oppieenthusiast https://open.spotify.com/user/315kycgock6jgkdxpgri6me37pjq https://www.tiktok.com/@theuher
